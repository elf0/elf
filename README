"elf" is a project for human being.
Everyone can join us.
We need you, human being need you!
It's a net, a super computer, a huge file system, a dictionary, a map, a help system...
It's everything!
Everyone can find one application for self.
Every machine and person will be a node in the net.
It's based a anonymous, crypted, distributed network.
The network never broke, every node can be store/transfer info, even people. 
Maybe Wifi/Bluetooth can connect some nodes, be a non-real-time local net. And info will be upload to the global net when node connected.

The goal:
  Anonymous:
    Source node location(ip...) must not appear at target peer, even source country.
    Random node/country should be a proxy for transfering a packet/session.
  Safe:
    Packet must be crypted by known method or unknown method(private session);
    File must be copied to many nodes/countries, any broken node/country won't broke the file.
    
  Public(P2P) and Private(Office, Home, Personal...) net.
  Proxy: Pass my data to target node or site.
  Sharing(Files, Disk, CPU, GPU...).
  Talking/Meeting(Text, Video, Audio... ).
  Searching:
    What: What is ***?(Dictionary)
    Where: Where is ***?(Map/Location, hotel, restaurant, WC, bank, hospital...).
    Who: Who is ***?(Get me the person's info if it's in net(public/private net))
    FullText: give me some articles, i'll find it my self.
  SOS: Help me! I'm in danger. For prefined nodes(family, friends, polices...), or every one who can help me.
