"elf" is a project for human being.
Everyone can join us.
We need you, human being need you!
It's a net, a super computer, a huge file system, a dictionary, a map, a help system...
It's everything!
Everyone can find one application for oneself.
Every device(pc, phone, disk, sdcard...) will be a node in the net.
It's based a anonymous, crypted, distributed network.
The network never be broken, packet will be transfered automatically by any possible device(wifi, bluetooth, 3G, satellite, disk, sdcard...).
Wifi/Bluetooth can connect some nodes, be a non-real-time local dynamic net. And info will be upload to the global net when node connected.
Packets on disk, sdcard will be automatically upload to global net by software.
All codes should be published into public domain.
Anyone can implement this project.

The goal:
  Anonymous:
    Every node don't know passing packet's content and source, only know target.
    Source node location(ip...) must not appear at target peer, even source country.
    Random node/country should be a proxy for transfering a packet/session.
  Safe:
    Packet must be crypted by known method or unknown method(private session);
    File must be copied to many nodes/countries, any broken node/country won't broke the file.
    All data(Packet, file, file block...) must take verify code.
    Fake packet will be checked out.
  Strong messenger:
    A particular(maybe all) message/file will be sent to targetï¼Œeven net is broken.
    (packet->phone/laptop/sdcard->airplane/bus->global net)
    Ever node is a messenger, it will detect a packet if reached target. if not it will send it, retry and retry.
  Applications:
    Public(P2P) and Private(Office, Home, Personal...) net.
    Proxy: Pass my data to target node or site.
    Sharing(Files, Disk, CPU, GPU...).
    Talking/Meeting(Text, Video, Audio... ).
    Searching:
      What: What is ***?(Dictionary)
      Where: Where is ***?(Map/Location, hotel, restaurant, WC, bank, hospital...).
      Who: Who is ***?(Get me the person's info if it's in net(public/private net))
      FullText: give me some articles, i'll find it my self.
    SOS: Help me! I'm in danger. Send to predefined nodes(family, friends, polices...), or every one who can help me.
